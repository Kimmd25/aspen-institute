                 1.  HAVE I ASKED MY CHILD WHY THEY WANT TO PLAY SPORTS?
                 <p class="checklist_p color3">Is it to have fun with classmates? Be tested at the highest level competitively? What do they want to get from the activity? Finding the right program starts with understanding a child’s social-emotional needs.
                 </p>

                2.	HAVE I ASKED MY CHILD WHICH SPORTS INTEREST THEM?
                <p class="checklist_p color3">Research shows that parents who are physically active Most kids get funneled into the same small handful of sports. But there are 120 of them offered across the U.S., with programs that might just be a few miles away. There’s a sport for every kid. Explore the options with them.

                3.	DO I ENCOURAGE UNSTRUCTURED AND LOOSELY STRUCTURED PLAY?
                <p class="checklist_p color3">Michael Jordan had a “love of the game” clause in his NBA contract that allowed him to play pickup hoops. Build the same ethos into your kid’s experience so it’s not all organized competition. Give kids equipment, and get out of the way.

            <div class="checklist_questions color1">
                4.	DOES MY CHILD’S PROGRAM PROMOTE MULTISPORT PARTICIPATION?
                <p class="checklist_p color3">As early as grade school, your child may get pressure to focus on playing one sport year-round. Research on child and athletic development rejects this approach. Ask program leaders how they’ll make room for playing other sports.
                </p>

                5.	ARE THE COACHES TRAINED IN KEY COMPETENCIES TO WORK WITH KIDS?
                <p class="checklist_p color3">The best programs mandate training in coaching philosophy/methods, sport skills & tactics, and safety protections including first aid and CPR (and, in collision sports like football and hockey, concussion management).
                </p>

                6.	DOES THE PROGRAM EMBRACE SMALL-SIDED, AGE-APPROPRIATE PLAY?
                <p class="checklist_p color3">Kids are not miniature adults. Six isn’t even 16. Children learn better and have more fun when play spaces, equipment and the number of participants on the field/court/ice are modified to their level. Small rosters help, too.

            <div class="checklist_questions color1">
                7.	DOES THE PROGRAM OFFER AN APPROPRIATE PRACTICE-TO-GAME RATIO?
                <p class="checklist_p color3">Kids want access to the action. You want them to be physically active, while also minimizing the costs and time allocated to away-game transportation. The best programs understand that development mostly occurs in training. At least two practices for every game is best.
                </p>

                8.	DOES THE PROGRAM ENCOURAGE EQUAL PLAYING TIME?
                <p class="checklist_p color3">There’s a time for programs to sort the weak from the strong in sports. It’s not before kids grow into their bodies, minds and interests. Through age 12, at least, programs should invest in every kid equally. That includes playing time.
            </div>

            <div class="checklist_questions color1">
                9.	DOES THE PROGRAM SYSTEMATICALLY SEEK FEEDBACK FROM KIDS AND PARENTS?
                <p class="checklist_p color3">A simple online survey is easy enough to create and send at the end of the season, collecting insights that can be shared with program leadership to improve quality and foster retention. Honor the programs that honor input.

                10.	DOES THE PROGRAM MAKE EFFORTS TO FOSTER PHYSICAL LITERACY?
                <p class="checklist_p color3">Physical Literacy is the ability, confidence and desire to be active for life, with an emphasis on fundamental movement skills – not just sport-specific skills. Learning to move well can open access to dozens of sports.
